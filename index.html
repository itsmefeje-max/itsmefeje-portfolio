      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a Roblox developer currently in the learning phase of LuaU,
        game design, and game development.
      </p>

      <p>
        My focus is on understanding core systems, clean scripting practices,
        and scalable game mechanics before publishing full projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio documents my progression as I build technical
        foundations and transition into real production work.

    <!-- CURRENT STATUS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Current Status</h2>

      <p>
        I am actively studying LuaU fundamentals, Roblox Studio workflows,
        and core gameplay systems such as player interaction, progression,
        and basic data handling.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site will evolve over time as I complete learning milestones
        and begin releasing public projects.

    <section>
      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <p>
        I am currently focused on learning and building core development skills.
        Public projects will be added here once they reach a presentable and
        production-ready state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Current areas of focus include LuaU scripting, gameplay systems,
        and basic game architecture within Roblox Studio.
