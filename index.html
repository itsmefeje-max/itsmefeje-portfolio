    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Roblox developer currently in the learning phase of LuaU,
        game design, and game development. My goal is to build a strong
        technical foundation before releasing full-scale public projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focus on understanding how systems work internally rather than
        relying on templates or shortcuts, allowing me to create scalable
        and maintainable game mechanics in the future.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Status</h2>
      <p>
        I am actively learning and experimenting through small internal
        prototypes and test systems that are not yet ready for public release.
      </p>

        This portfolio will continue to evolve as I complete learning
        milestones and transition into production-ready projects.
