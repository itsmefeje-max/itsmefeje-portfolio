    <h1>Itsmefeje</h1>
    <h3>Roblox Developer</h3>

    <p>
      I am a Roblox developer currently in the learning phase of LuaU,
      game design, and game development.
    </p>

    <p>
      My focus is on understanding core systems, clean scripting practices,
      and scalable game mechanics before publishing full projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio documents my progression as I build technical
      foundations and transition into real production work.
